Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC
sequencing (scATAC-seq) data involves combining gene expression
information with chromatin accessibility data at a single-cell
resolution. This integration can reveal insights into the regulatory
mechanisms influencing gene expression and cell state. Assuming you have
processed data in cell-gene and cell-peak formats, here is a simplified
work breakdown structure (WBS) for integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq
data:

**Preparation**

1.1. Review and documentation of data formats

1.2. Verification of data quality and preprocessing status

1.3. Setup of computational environment and required software tools

**Data Normalization and Scaling**

2.1. Normalization of scRNA-seq data (if not already normalized)

2.2. Normalization of scATAC-seq data (if not already normalized)

2.3. Scaling and variance stabilization

**Dimensionality Reduction**

3.1. Dimensionality reduction of scRNA-seq data (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)

3.2. Dimensionality reduction of scATAC-seq data (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)

3.3. Identification of highly variable features in both datasets

**Data Integration**

Integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets to enable a unified
analysis that combines gene expression and chromatin accessibility data
at a single-cell resolution.

4.1 **Identification of Integration Anchors or Common Features**

4.1.1 Review of Literature and Existing Methods

-   Task: Research existing methodologies for identifying integration
    anchors in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets.

-   Deliverable: A report summarizing effective strategies for anchor
    identification.

    of methods suitable for the project\'s datasets.

4.1.2 Analysis of Overlapping Features

-   Task: Perform an analysis to identify overlapping features (genes,
    genomic regions) between the datasets.

-   Deliverable: A list of common features across scRNA-seq and
    scATAC-seq datasets.

-   Completion Criteria: Identification of a comprehensive set of
    overlapping features that can serve as potential anchors for
    integration.

4.1.3 Selection of Integration Anchors

-   Task: Using identified common features, select anchors based on
    their relevance and representation across datasets.

-   Deliverable: A finalized list of integration anchors.

-   Completion Criteria: Selection of anchors that are statistically
    validated and agreed upon by the project team.
